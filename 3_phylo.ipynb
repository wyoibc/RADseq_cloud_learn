    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first two, modules, we assembled RADseq data with ipyrad and ran some population clustering anlayses. **Next, we'll make a couple quick phylogenetic trees of our samples from the ipyrad assembly.** These anlayses will not require the output from submodule 2 on population structure, only submodule 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will continue to use the snake data that we have used so far, but note that phylogenetic methods are also commonly used to reconstruct the history of viruses like [Covid](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abe3261) and [other pathogens](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/66/1/e47/2670001).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use two different programs that have different theoretical underpinnings: IQ-TREE (IQ-TREE 2 paper [here](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/37/5/1530/5721363?ref=https://githubhelp.com) and documentation [here](http://www.iqtree.org/doc/)) and [SVDQuartets](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/30/23/3317/206559?login=true). IQ-TREE is a maximum likelhood method for estimating phylogenies on concatentated alignments. Most models in IQ-TREE and similar maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogeny programs assume that all sites in an alignment share a single underlying tree. This assumption may be broken for many reasons, including incomplete lineage sorting and gene flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate two specific methods to infer phylogenies, but explaining the theoretical underpinnings of phylogenetic inference and the various classes of methods is beyond the scope of this tutorial. There are a great many programs and approaches for inferring phylogenies, and which one you choose will ultimately depend on your data and the questions you want to answer. If you need a general introduction to phylogenetics, Felsenstein's [Inferring Phylogenies](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/inferring-phylogenies-9780878931774?cc=us&lang=en&), Baum and Smith's [Tree Thinking: An Introduction to Phylogenetic Biology](https://store.macmillanlearning.com/us/product/Tree-Thinking-An-Introduction-to-Phylogenetic-Biology/p/1936221160?srsltid=AfmBOorzK_ikT0AD1kCOswzDK_hGQ4t5ht7iQp_l5MnGxGDe9JtSKkzg), and Kubatko and Knowles' [Species Tree Inference: A Guide to Methods and Applications](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691207599/species-tree-inference?srsltid=AfmBOorMTxQfQ0L9s4oXURRlGYZhYRM2N3ggYRKpAhIz1mPR8_ffdf9T) are excellent places to start. [Maddison (1997)](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/46/3/523/1651369) and [Degnan and Rosenberg (2006)](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020068) both offer good introductions to the differences between species trees and gene trees and the problems that incomplete lineage sorting can cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gene flow is still notoriously hard to detect and adequately model in phylogenetic inference, but many programs now exist that are robust to variation in phylogenetic signal across sites/genes caused by incomplete lineage sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVDQuartets is one such method. SVDQuartets uses a quartet approach that is statistically consistent with the multi-species coalescent without the computational burden of explicitly modeling the multi-species coalescent process.\n",
