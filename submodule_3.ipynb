    "# Phylogenetic inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll make a couple quick phylogenetic trees of our samples from the ipyrad assembly. We'll use two different programs that have different theoretical underpinnings: IQ-TREE and SVDQuartets. IQ-TREE is a maximum likelhood method for estimating phylogenies on concatentated alignments. Most models in IQ-TREE and similar maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogeny programs assume that all sites in an alignment share a single underlying tree. This assumption may be broken for many reasons, including incomplete lineage sorting and gene flow. Gene flow is still notoriously hard to detect and adequately model in phylogenetic inference, but many programs now exist that are robust to variation in phylogenetic signal across sites/genes caused by incomplete lineage sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVDQuartets is one such method. SVDQuartets uses a quartet approach that is statistically consistent with the multi-species coalescent without the computational burden of explicitly modeling the multi-spoecies coalescent process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A full discussion of the performance of these programs in different scenarios is beyong the scope of this tutorial, but if your research involves phylogenetic inference, we highly recommend that you do some deeper reading.\n",
