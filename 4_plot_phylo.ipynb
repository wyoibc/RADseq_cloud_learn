    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, we used IQ-TREE and SVDQuartets to estimate phylogenetic trees from the alignments we assembled with ipyrad in the first tutorial. The output from these are text representations of phylogenies, which we'll need to plot to make sense of. There are various programs that be used to visualize trees. [FigTree](https://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) is a popular GUI-based, interactive program, but to make customizable, publication-quality phylogenetic graphics, it's hard to beat the options available in R. Using R, we can plot and manipulate phylogenies, plot the to maps, and even combine them with the population clsutering results from the second tutorial.\n",

This is because within each clade, individuals are members of a population cluster that share genes, and are therefore not actually organized into a hierarchical tree structure.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we used R to make high-quality plot of the results from the phylogenetic analyses that we ran in the previous tutorial. We also combined these results with the population genetic clustering results from tutorial 2 to create a single map figure that shows phylogenetic and population genetic results. These methods should enable you to make publication-quality figures, and there are many ways to customize these plots beyond what we've demonstrated here. There are also many other ways to visualize trees beyond the couple of `ape` and `phytools` functions we've shown here. `Phytools` has many other functions for plotting phylogenies and data and there is also the package `ggtree`, which extends the functionality of the popular `ggplot2` package and allows very fine control of plotting parameters. \n",
