    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last module, `1_ipyrad.ipynb`, we started with an ipyrad tutorial to process RADseq data from the red diamond rattlesnake (Crotalus ruber). We assembled the data from raw reads into aligned sequences, generating files that contain SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) or loci on a common coordinate system for each individual sample. This alignment enables us to make inferences based on variation across samples. In this module, we'll perform basic population genetic analyses to examine population structure, running all analyses in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will continue with the snake data that we assembled in the previous module, but note that these population genetic methods can be used with any kind of genomic or sub-genomic sequence data, and can be applied in a variety of contexts including studying [pathogen evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.16395) and [human population genetics and admixture](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13323-015-0024-0).\n",

    "\n",
    "Population assignment is a critical step in many population genetic and phylogeographic studies. Most downstream methods for estimating gene flow, divergence, population size, and other interesting population parameters require populations to be specified by you. If you have population structure in your data that you have not adequately accounted for, this can bias many types of analyses. E.g., if you try to estimate the history of population size changes in a group of samples that you assume are a single population when they actually come from multiple discrete populations, this will bias your results. Similarly, if you are running genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genes that are associated with some phenotype, including unaccounted population structure can result in the identification of spurious associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to assign individuals to discrete populations. In some cases, you may have a priori ideas about population boundaries based on geographic discontinuities, differences in morphology across a species range, previous genetic data, or other sources of information. However, most of the time you will want to infer the number of populations and population membership of individuals directly from your data. This is essentially a classification problem: we are seeking to classify our whole set of genetic samples into a number of populations, often while also seeking to determine how many populations are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most commonly used programs for the inference of population structure is the aptly named program [Structure](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure.html). Structure is a model-based clustering method that seeks to split individuals into clusters such that linkage disequilibrium is minimized and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is maximized within each cluster. Structure is a Bayesian method that relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, and can thus become somewhat unwieldy with large datasets. Many fast alternatives have been developed since the advent of Structure, including [Admixture](https://dalexander.github.io/admixture/) which utilizes the same model from Structure, but in a faster maximum likelihood implementation. Other alternative approaches do not explicitly model Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or linkage disequilibrium, including the sNMF approach implemented in the [LEA R package](http://membres-timc.imag.fr/Olivier.Francois/LEA/files/LEA_github.pdf) and DAPC as implemented in the [Adegenet R package](https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet). All of these methods often produce comparable results, which are often visualized as barplots of the estimated membership of each sample in one or more population clusters or as pie charts of the same information plotted onto a map as show in the figures below.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If using DAPC to estimate population membership, it is important to note that in my experience, with large amounts of data, DAPC is very good at estimating which population a sample belongs to, but if a sample is admixed, it will be confidently placed into the population that it shares the most ancestry with. Barplots or pie charts of DAPC reflect the uncertainty in classification rather than amount of admixture, so care should be taken not to interpret DAPC plots the same way as plots from Strucure, Admixture, sNMF, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here we will use sNMF**\n",
    "\n",
    "I like to use sNMF rather than Structure because it's very fast and produces results highly similar to Structure. However, sNMF can have trouble with samples that have high amounts of missing data, with high missing data causing individuals to appear to be admixed. In such cases, the estimates of admixture that you get out of Structure or Admixture may be better than those from sNMF.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The snmf function requires a `geno` file as input, and requires that it has the extension `.geno`. We want to use only unlinked SNPs here (i.e., 1 SNP per RAD locus, assumed to be unlinked), and the `geno` file of unlinked snps from ipyrad has the extension `ugeno`, so we'll copy the file and give it a new extension:"

    "\n",
    "An additional critical consideration is that continuous spatial genetic structure across the range of a population can be highly problematic for population structure methods, which assume that all structure is discrete. One of the most common types of continuous spatial structure is isolation by distance (IBD), which occurs when dispersal is limited and individuals that are geographically closer are more related than individuals that are geographically distant. If IBD is strong enough, population structure methods can incorrectly infer the presence of multiple discrete populations with a gradient of admixture between the farthest individuals. This problem is reviewed well in [Bradburd et al. 2018](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-abstract/210/1/33/6088031) and they developed the method conStruct to simultaneously continuous and discrete spatial structure. I have had trouble getting it to work on my own data, so we won't use it in this tutorial. In any case, testing for isolation by distance and being aware of its potentially misleading effects can help to prevent incorrect inferences of population structure.\n",

We demonstrated how to calculate heterozygosity statistics, then ran methods to test for and visualize population structure. We introduced the clustering algorithm sNMF, prinicipal comonents analysis, and mantel tests for isolation by distance. Finally, we showed how to generate plots of population structure, including mapping these results.\n",
